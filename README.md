# Spotify Clone

This project is a clone of the popular music streaming service Spotify, built using React and other modern web technologies. The clone mimics the design and functionality of the Spotify app, allowing users to browse and play music, create and manage playlists, and explore a vast library of songs.

## Features


- **Browse Music**: Users can explore a vast collection of songs, albums, and artists. The app provides various ways to discover new music based on genres, moods, and more.

- **Playlists**: Users can create, edit, and delete playlists. They can add and remove songs from their playlists, reorder tracks, and customize their playlists' names and images.

- **Search**: A powerful search feature allows users to find specific songs, albums, artists, or playlists quickly.

- **Now Playing**: The app shows the currently playing song, allowing users to play, pause, skip, and adjust the playback position.

- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, providing an optimal experience for all users.

## Technologies Used
